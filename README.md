## Project Overview

"Press the Number" is a simple game where players need to click or press highlighted numbers as quickly as possible to earn points within a specified timeframe. The game features multiple levels, each with an increasing number of numbers to press simultaneously. The objective is to achieve the highest score by the end of the game.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/press-the-number.git```

2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Launch the project by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the game's user interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styling and layout for the game elements.
- `grid.js`: JavaScript file responsible for creating and updating the number grid.
- `numberGenerator.js`: JavaScript file responsible for generating the numbers to press.
- `main.js`: The main JavaScript file that ties everything together and initializes the game.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you will see a grid of numbers.

2. Click or press the numbers that are highlighted in sequence as quickly as possible.

3. Each correct click will earn you points, and your combo streak will increase.

4. Be careful not to click the wrong number, as it will break your combo streak and deduct points.

5. As you progress through levels, more numbers will be highlighted simultaneously, making the game more challenging.

6. Try to achieve the highest score before the timer runs out.
